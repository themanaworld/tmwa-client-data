This is an Interlude.
 
Is it time to take down Zax De'Kagen, or will he best the adventurers?
Get the Black Rose, explore the maze, seek the truth.

And then, there was silence.
 
Nobody heard from Jande or Zax De'Kagen for a while.
 
In the apparence of normality amidst the doomsday, questions are left unanswered.
Unable to return to Keshlam Maze, but in hold of the clues, one can only especulate.
 
What is the real meaning of things.
The calm can only mean one thing: The storm is soon to come.

##BMinor Balance Notes##b
 
We did several minor balance changes, like tweaking
Sand Cutter's damage, increasing Mana Guardians XP,
and several other minor things which are actually
very important but even so, are still minor.
 
##BSome patches you might have missed##b
 
On April 1st, we pushed a whole new equipment set to
Iilia, with brawlers in mind. We also added the quest
for a new weapon, the Sand Cutter.

##BBrawler Class: Assassin Set Released##b
 
After a huge attempt of assassination at Luvia,
which naturally failed, the chest at Iilia's Inn
now have a complete assassin garment available.
 
This set can only be wore if you're unarmed!
 
##BNew Weapon: Sand Cutter##b
 
With regards to AxlTrozz's Desert Temple, which
unfortunately was never finished of being mapped,
a new melee weapon, superior to Setzer, is available.
 
You'll need around level 85 to equip it, and this
is as far as our hints will go.
 
##BMana Guardians Ritual##b
 
The Mana Guardians performed a ritual, which lowered
their defense and luck permanently, but hit the Banshee
Bow in full, and it no longer crits.
 
However, having the curse changed by this ritual, its
base damage was increased, and it even make the archers
faster. Nobody knows for how long this will persist.
 
##BMonster Hunters Update##b
 
Aidan and Ishi decided to give monster points for those
whom defeat Mana Guardians, Tormenta, and some of the
newer monsters ingame.
 
They hope that this way, adventurers all over
The Mana World prevent it falling in hands of the
invading army.
 
##BDoomsday Event - The Invasion##b
 
The Mage Council of Tulimshar has monitored events
following the Great Quake and feel that something
ominous is spreading throughout The Mana World.
Monsters seem to of come out of every shadowy corner
and petty dieties has begun to make presence in dark
places. The council has made the call and you are
just one of the many people that will battle the
forces of evil, sending them back to the depths they
came from.
 
Be it warrior, archer or mage, you have answered the
call from the leaders of the world to fight back the
darkness that spread after the Great Quake. Even so,
the monsters strength is overwhelming, and not even
Tormenta is staying behind the eternal seals any longer.
 
And sensing adventurers and the mana world residents
weakness, someone decided it was a good idea to send an
invading army...

Hello Everyone!
 
This is a routine update, created to push the outcome of several
polls which were on Feedback section of the Forums.
 
##BNerf Banshee Bow##b
 
One of the most polemic threads, but not the most polemic one.
 
It ended up with the Banshee Bow damage being adjusted from 90 to 85.
 
The "average value" would be lower, but nobody likes nerfing, right?
 
##BIncrease Black Scorpion, Snakes and Spiders EXP##b
 
A lot of players wanted these monsters to give more experience,
but it was not enough to give what they wanted.
 
In the end, the experience of these three monsters was nearly doubled.
 
##BChristmas Event changed##b
 
The less polemic of all, Christmas Event allows players to gain a
free level.
But this only works if your level was smaller than 99. Now, this
limit was raised to 135, to follow the Experience table.

##BHigher Level Cap##b
 
After a bug which caused several issues (including data loss),
it left behind a "feature" which increased level cap to 135!
 
We asked the community about it, and most players said that
they're fine with a higher level cap, too.
 
##BTormenta the Boss##b
 
Tormenta came directly from the Abyss and is looking to run
loose in the surface after a long time. She also stole several
masks from previous Halloween events.
 
Killing her might not only make her drop a rare, but will also
give a decent amount of experience to anyone involved.
Note: Tormenta is at least as difficult as Luvia, so be prepared!
 
##BDevelopment Continues##b
 
As announced previously, we're hoping to have rEvolt released
soon. If everything goes well and as planned, we'll be releasing
after the Halloween ends; But this depends a bit on contributors.
 
##BMinor corrections##b
 
We've also fixed Sailor's and Captain Hat's defense.
In case you had these decorative items, they now give
the defense they promised.

##7Shiny new website##0

##BMobile-friendly website!##b
The homepage of The Mana World has been entirely redesigned to work on
mobile devices. It should now scale accordingly with the size of your
display so you shouldn't need to zoom anymore. Everything should be in
roughly the same places as before except for Account Recovery, which
has been moved under Support. Please report any issues you may encounter.
 
##BTMW Hardcore##b
A new "world" has been added to the world selection list: TMW Hardcore.
This server is intended to provide a bigger challenge to players who have
become experts on the main server. It plays like normal except for these
important differences:

* Death is permanent. There is no way to revive your character.
* Obtaining experience and leveling is much faster.
* The level cap is 127 and stats can go as high as 120.
* It is possible to kill other players in any map (except towns).
* Upon killing a player, you obtain all of their belongings.

 
Please note: The Hardcore server is NOT intended to be a replacement
for the main server; it is only an experiment and may close down at
any point in the future. Think of it more as a side-quest.

Hello Everyone!
 
I'm making this announcement to tell you that our first
development milestone for the new server's first release, 
titled The Mana World: rEvolt, is now 100% completed. 
The initial deadline was set at 31/05/19 but we managed to 
finish one month ahead of schedule!
 
The milestone was called Artis Sewer and included all content 
relating to the underground maps under the city of Artis 
as well as some other bits of content that we wanted 
to be out at the same time. The next milestone, Artis Legion, 
currently sits at 75% completion with a deadline of 30/06/19, 
but given how quickly things have been moving I would say 
we're well ahead of schedule for this one as well!
 
The third and final milestone, Hurnscald, 
encompasses the biggest part of the release: 
the town of Hurnscald and the surrounding woodland 
region of Argaes. Its deadline represents an 
approximate deadline for the entire release 
and is currently set at 06/09/19.
 
I want to say thank you to the people who have worked 
the most and the hardest in recent weeks to get us this far. 
Check out my forum post for my rant about that 
and some links to current development!

Hello to everyone, regardless of gender or race! Yes, I am addressing
the shy Tritans among us!
Oh, your dog might also be interested in this.
 
So our last edition of the newspaper was on ##1March 1st##0.
It was about 45 days ago, so lets do a new post!
 
Here is the current progress report for the new server:
 
@@https://forums.themanaworld.org/download/file.php?id=13446|https://forums.themanaworld.org/download/file.php?id=13446@@##0
 
So while I would love to ##1bore everyone to death##0, talking about how
many placeholders we've added this last period - from adding a hideout
on Artis (where? It is a secret, of course!) to the fight against the Legion -
with several bugfixes, bringing Wyara back, adding minimaps to most
maps while still keeping Rossy's caves a secret, improving several minor
things, and adding some skills. Because seriously, we are The Mana World.
A Mana World without magic makes no sense, right?
 
But the thing is, I can't.
I know, many have missed Mona's dad's rescue operation. I know, many
missed the incredible desync which brought 4144 to release
ManaPlus 1.9.3.23. Throwing stuff in sewers, the Peter quest
redesign, and making sandwiches.
...but I don't have time for that. In case you just said "Neat, there
are progress bars on the picture", there are also due dates!
 
This means, as our (late) TMW birthday gift to the community,
##1we decided on a deadline##0!
 
You know, the thing is - not even the developers can wait another year
for this game to be playable.
So we decided on a deadline, after lots of drama and bikeshedding on IRC,
as tradition demands, somewhere between ##1September and October 2019##0!
 
So, no more time to stop and chat, we have a game to finish if we want
to still be able to call it The Mana World.
 
Finally, do you know what makes The Mana World, The Mana World?
Here is a hint:
It is not the name. It is not the quests. It is not the graphics. And it is not
the player data either.
If you find out, please do not share. :>

In exchange, you will be rewarded on and after October 31st with some wonderful items that Gak has collected over

##7The more things change...##0
##32014-04-16##0
##1Attention Major Release:##0

* Mana EOL
* Server dependencies
* Script clean-up
* Magic clean-up
* Sprite 1.5 - Npcs As Sprites
* Tilesets
* Travel / Death / Warps
* Client-data clean-up
* Tonori Improvement
* Graveyard Improvement

 
Mana EOL:
    With this release, we are finally declaring the
Mana client obsolete. 90% of players are already
using ManaPlus.
 
Server dependencies:
    The next release of the server code will require
a newer version of GCC: 4.7 instead of 4.6. This is
possible because Ubuntu is releasing a new LTS
so that servers can reasonably be expected to be
able to upgrade.
 
    GCC 4.7 will be supported for much longer - a
year and a half or two years, until the next Debian
release.
 
    The next release will also drop the dependency
on Flex and Bison ... which is more significant for
making the build system simpler and the surrounding
code cleaner than for actually being hard to acquire.
 
Script:
    TMWA increased the level of debugging for
script parsing. The script language no longer
allows default fall throughs or '-' for a
menu option. It now reports Unused & Duplicate
labels The menu fix was added to pave the
development of dynamic menus.
Simply running your script in the server reports
all errors in the scripts.
 
Magic:
    Magic is now using a new config file format,
which will simplify build dependencies in future.
Anybody with local spells will need to manually
convert them. Although we have some helper
programs (tmwa-spell-convert and tmwa-sexpr),
For support of these ask on IRC
@@irc://chat.freenode.net/themanaworld|irc://chat.freenode.net/themanaworld@@##0
 
Sprite 1.5/Npcs As Sprites:
    Sprite directory naming convention cleaned
up. If an NPC wasn't animated it was made into
a player sprite with equipment. Thus anything
you see most the NPCs wearing will/can be
wearable player gear. We fixed and added more
gear than was currently in the main so a bunch
of new items have been added. Additional attack
frames add more weapon varieties and NPC
animations. As since the npcs are a sprite any
action the player sprite can do the NPC could.
It allows us to implement a mobile NPC. Most of
the sprites have dyes now. Including the player
sprite. This will make adding new races easier.
 
    Making the NPCs player sprites makes it
easier to create them as well. If you can edit
an xml you can create a NPC. This will make it
quicker to start developing. Custom/Special
NPCs still exist, (see GY INN), They need to be
justified as to why they can't be a Doll model.
 
    Errors in the sprite should now be clearly
visible as we fixed the error image in the
client-data. It will draw an ugly error tile.
 
Tilesets:
    Naming covention enforced to make dealing
with sets easier. Unused/old or broken sets
fixed or removed from repo except the plain
castle set. The Forrest was removed as it needs
to be properly cut to make it easier to map with.
    Tilesets will begin to be collasped into each
other. As they share a common/similiar theme
and/or style.
    We added animated water to some of the maps.
The tileset will work with all of the maps and
tilesets in game.
    We've begun to fill empty spaces in the tilesets
with a Open/Free marker. These will help us find
maps with errors.
 
Travel / Death / Warps:
    Plain Hitchiker Towels are now part of the
starting gear. If you lost, sold or don't have a
towel ask the nearest soul menhir for a replacement.
All towel colors are  available and each is set
to a location. Only the plain undyed towel can bind
to a soul menhir. The towels now have to wait to
recharge to be used again.
    Death is no longer travel system. Localized
graveyards keeps you close to the action. This
means shorter walks back from  the graveyard and
illia doesn't reset your savepoint anymore.Using a
towel, a warp or walking is the only way back to a
city.
    Ship Travel does not cost anything anymore. The
ship now moves between the major docks. The ferry
schdules are available by the docks so you know where
it currently is. Once aboard wait for the ship to
come into the location you want and disembark.
    Dyrin's sect of wizards "The Travelers" have
appeared in more locations about the world. speaking
with 2 members of his sect will allow you to move
between them, for a price. Members are located
throughout the world.
 
Tonori Improvement:
    Added major art map additions to Tulimshar &
surrounding areas. Castle, Noble, Beach Cliffs ,
& etc.
    Starting area clean-up. Quest now uses bitmasking.
Sorfina gives you your first towel. Altered NPCs and
map to make room for Beach Cliffs.
    The children playing hide & seek have been spread
out more to encourage exploring the wider areas
surrounding the city.
 
Graveyard Improvement:
    Added major art map additions to the Graveyard &
surrounding areas. More maps to grind Xp and to offer
a change of pace. These maps also have 3 new
mini-bosses for 60+ level characters. The Graveyard
reset has been removed.

This year has been horrible for Santa. 
Nothing turned out as it was intended, in fact he didn't 
even make it at the usual date.
 
Gladly, Avalia, Santa's utterly attractive apprentice stepped in
to make Christmas happen for all of the children and lonely
people around the mana world. Go to his workshop and see if 
you can help to make the magic of christmas happen, 
 
... or make it a complete disaster, 
Orum has some helpers hidden in Nivalis who will guide your
way sabotaging christmas.
 
This release is very late, so we are going to change reward 
and event time accordingly.
 
The good thing is that you will now be able to visit 
Santa's Inn throughout the year. 
Cassy breathed life into all those reinboos of last 
years Holidays.
Fothers Candied Slimes are going to cause the sweetest nightmares
you have ever had. Not sure if you are cruel enough to kill
a Pollett.

##7Icon and Weapon Updates##0
##32013-11-30##0
 
With this update we ship new and better item icons.
Those have been done a long time ago and we
finally finished reviewing them all.
 
The behavior of items when you do not meet their
requirements has changed.
 
As a result, a new type of ranged weapon has
been introduced: the Sling Shot. You can get it
somewhere in Tulimshar. We are aware of some
small graphical glitches.
 
The behaviour of the happy-curse
for dark mages has been changed.
You might want to try it out. ]:-)

Also, some minor bugs have been fixed with Waric and Rossy.
Alas poor Waric, Will he ever learn to behave properly?

##7Fixes in Server Code##0
##32013-09-28##0
 
As you might have found out we had another restart yesterday.
 
Most of the changes for this restart are under the hood: this was
a Server Code release. Meaning the server's software was
changed but not the content. Hence user-facing changes are minimal,
but we'll outline below what's relevant.
 
The restart didn't work as smoothly as expected but we
are working hard on fixing all the issues which turned up.
 
Currently known bugs that affect players:
    * None
 
Other bugs:
    * GM logs are now full-buffered (faster) instead of line-buffered.
    * Admin documentation is wrong.
 
Fixed bugs:
    * Problems with startup speed (possibly not new, fixed anyway).
    * Guildbot wouldn't start.
    * Some accounts and storages with corrupted items were deleted.
    * You can turn every direction except right.
    * Inability to trade, except when naked.
    * Warp bug related to the new Orum/Waric quest.
    * Elemental bonus/malus not applied to magic.
    * Update stats from the new CDN.
    * Script bug with Kylian and checkweight.
    * Drop order was wrong.
    * Rossy caves now notice when you win fights.
    * Fix an incorrectly marked assertion, which could fail.

A big behavioural change has been made to the Login Server
From now on the login name is case sensitive, this means
it matters whether you write a capital letter or not.
##8e.g. if you registered an account name Test, and always
logged in as test, this now no longer works. You have to
log in as Test.##0

Please be aware that these code changes were necessary to move
the game forward. The server was formerly very hard to work on or
modify. This update goes a long way to fixing that and will allow the
developers to bring you new and exciting things in the future.
 
We are very sorry for the inconvenience. We have been working
as hard as we can to fix all the issues above.

##7Astral Magic Extension##0
##32013-09-14##0
 
We have a small content release today.
A witch in Tulimshar has found some daunting spells
for mages who are experienced in Astral Magic.
Talk to her about that. Maybe she is willing to teach you.
 
With this update, we have added some minor bugfixes for the
Waric script, Bluepar sprite and Wicked Mushroom sprite.

##7Announcing Code update - Introducing Dark Magic##0
##32013-09-03##0
 
##8First, a technical announcement. During a future
restart, TMW will start requiring your username
to exactly match the case that you signed up with.
 
Previously, this was enforced erratically, and led
to people losing access to their accounts. If, after
the update, you are unsure of the case of the account
##1and have already tried lowercase, UPPERCASE, and TitleCase,##8
please contact o11c or Frost.
 
Now, back to your regularly scheduled content news.##0
 
Today we have introduced two new pieces.
 
First of all, the Orum extension is finished.
Orum and his master Waric have set a new base
to mess with Sagatha. Seek them out! They
hide somewhere in the Caves north of Sagatha's
Forests.
 
Someone has seen a few new spells being used.
No one is yet sure what exactly it is but a dark aura
has been percieved somewhere north of Hurnscald.
Find it! Maybe you can gain something useful!
 
Last but not least we have to announce bad news
for the project but good news for her:
Jenalya has, after finishing the Orum extension,
resigned from her position as Lead Content
Developer. We dedicate this news to her and
wish her only the very best for her future. She
contributed beyond words and her leaving
will leave a spot we will have to work hard to fill.
Wushin and tux9th took over as Lead Content Developers
and give their best to bring quality content to you,
like Jenalya did.

##7Wushin overhauled caves, Ferry now goes to Nivalis##0
##32013-06-29##0
 
This release brings a few new additions to the game:
 
Wushin overhauled the desert caves with an awesome
new cave tileset. Also the sewers below Tulimshar are
now accessible. Make sure to check them out!
 
Malivox took the occasion to stop camping in the
desert and moved into a small house south of
Tulimshar.
 
Frozenbeard has expanded his ferry service in
Nivalis. You can now go between Nivalis and
the other major docks both ways. Proper docks for
Nivalis are being worked on.
 
With a ferry now serving Nivalis, Dyrin will send you
somehwere else in Kaizei instead, away from Nivalis.
 
As usual there are also a lot of smaller fixes and
changes. Thanks to everyone who reported issues
and helped fix these things!

##7Double Exp and Drop Weekend##0
##32013-06-07##0
 
This weekend we're temporarily doubling both the
experience rate and the drop rates for all monsters,
to give the chance to recover from the rollback
we had due to filesystem corruption.
 
There are also some bug fixes and new content:
 
The craftsmen of Tulimshar have finally moved to the
renovated Forge at the Northern Market, so the
Wizard's Inn is back to offering a calm stay for visitors.
 
In the woodland area the mysterious Evil Obelisk which
summons beings from the astral plane for the mundane
price of gold has drastically reduced its demands.
 
On the technical side, in case of network congestion,
you will no longer be kicked with an invalid packet error.

##7Server Crash and Rollback##0
##32013-06-05##0
 
We had a server crash, and had to restore everything from offline backup.
 
34 hours were lost, from about 17:30 (UTC) on 4 June to about 03:30 on 6 June. This affects the game, the forums, and the wiki.
 
We're going to set up hourly offsite backups of game, forum, and wiki data so that future outages are less painful.

##7Small Bugfixes##0
##32013-04-28##0
 
We're having a bugfix release today.
 
The main areas that have been fixed are Brodomir's PvP Cave
and Orum's quest, both in the
caves below Hurnscald.
 
Additionally, there were a lot of small fixes
on maps, spelling and grammar, and more.
 
We'd like to thank all the people who reported issues and helped
testing!

##7Easter Event and Miley's Hero##0
##32013-03-21##0
 
Today we have a content release.
 
As always there are a number of bugfixes,
but also two new quests.
 
One of them is an annual Easter event created by Pjotr Orial.
It lasts from March, 22th to April, 25th, and can be
repeated every year.
Watch out around Hurnscald for some hidden Easter Eggs!
 
The other quest is about the admiration of a little
girl in Hurnscald that sees you growing from an
inexperienced adventurer to an impressive hero.
Backstage, this was also about a great community effort.
veryape conceived of the idea for this quest and was able
to make it happen with the help of many people who were
assisting with the graphics, scripting, spell checking,
testing and giving valuable feedback.
 
Lastly, Brodomir's cave under Hurnscald has been made
easier for attracting fighters from all over the world.
