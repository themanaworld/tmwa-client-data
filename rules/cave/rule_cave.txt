# Rules for caves

# basic stuff: each rule-tile gets a default tile
./rule_cave_001.tmx

# straight walls:
./rule_cave_002.tmx

# corners at walls
./rule_cave_003.tmx
./rule_cave_004.tmx
./rule_cave_005.tmx

# water in caves:
./rule_cave_006.tmx
./rule_cave_007.tmx

# rules for entrances, has bad exception handling,
# so mind where to put entrances. (So avoid putting them near corners)
./rule_cave_008.tmx

# straight carpets
./rule_cave_009.tmx

# corners in carpets
./rule_cave_010.tmx

# all tiles, which are walkable, but have unwalkable neighbors,
# should be unwalkable
# example: a decorative stone in a sea

./rule_cave_050.tmx

# error handling: some situations cannot be handled properly with this ruleset:
# so indicate these situations with the error-tile
./rule_cave_100.tmx
